**Auto Clicker**

I created this auto clicker for computer automation without having to download an app to prevent programs/games from detecting any modifications. 

Steps:
1. You must install python to be able to run this file
2. Save the code as a .py file
3. Run the file as an administrator

Notes: 
- Press Escape key on your keyboard once you are done using the clicker
- You can adjust the frequency by replacing the click frequency in line 8 of the code.
- you also need to do pip install the following:
  - pip install pywin32
  - pip install keyboard

Good luck and have fun!
